CPSC 312 Day One Notes
======================

## Desktop vs Mobile
Big question to ask is how coupled is software w/ hardware  

Desktop
* macOS
* Windows
* Linux

Mobile
* iOS
* Android

## 3 ways to develop mobile app
1. Native App: Using the device manufacturer's SDK and API's
 * SDK: Software development kit
 * API: Application Programming Interface
 * Very close to hardware
1. Web Apps: Mobile responsive websites
 * One single codebase can serve entire app
 * Further from hardware (cannot access sensor data on phone)
1. Hybrid: Common codebase that is compiled into a native distro (APK)
 * Can raise dependancy issues
 * May not always work correctly with newer API's
